# lit-html-example

A simple example how to use lit-html

## Trying example.

In order to test this example you need a newer browser that support modules, else this will not work. It should be possible to use babel and get it to work on older browsers but it's not in the scope of this example.

First of we need to install the express server modules
```
npm install
```

Then we start the test server
```
npm start
```
